We're at a junction.

Tech is mainstream - supercomputers in our pockets, instant worldwide communication,
business models disrupted before breakfast. The singularity, once hippy Californian nonsense,
starts to feel tangible - people are [slicing up brains](http://incf.ini.uzh.ch/catmaid/?pid=2&zp=9&yp=3835&xp=5115&sid0=2&s0=0) to work our their detailed neural
wiring, others are starting the [first hints](http://www.color.com/) of a Searle's Chinese room built
out of consumers.

And yet, it is so fragile.

The servers of a major gaming system [are hacked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network_outage), maybe 
our [document storage](https://docs.google.com)
will be next, the world's private memos auctioned from Russia to the highest
bidder. The weather always felt wrong, but it feels [more wrong](http://climateprogress.org/2011/05/16/nasa-hottest-april-record-colombia/). Progress on
the politics of the destruction of our civilisation are [nothing but backwards](http://climateprogress.org/2011/05/20/l-a-times-obama-is-throwing-the-environment-and-public-health-under-a-bus-to-get-reelected/),
with less hope each passing day.

There are a few hopeful things.

[unhosted][http://www.unhosted.org/] hints at how we can break out of a
centralised, flaky and privacy risking Internet. At least [one startup](http://singly.com/)
is quietly working away for the future interests of the user. 

Maybe in the future everyone will be communicating by syncing encrypted files
to [javascript CouchDB
instances](http://damienkatz.net/2009/04/couchdb_in_the_browser.html) on their
smartphone.

[Dark Mountain](http://www.dark-mountain.net/) at least admit to the big
environmental problem, and have a swirling of interesting people.

And somewhere, deep in a git hash-object, someone makes their first
blog post by forking.

And someone else realises they've just had their strangest invite to [a
festival](http://uncivilisation.co.uk/) that they've had for a little while.

See you there!
