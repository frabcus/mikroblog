In line with a recent post on my main blog, I start a new series of experiments. This blog is not sitting
on top of Tumblr, Posterous or Wordpress. It's on the Heroku platform, is written in Ruby (technical details:
most things are accompilshed with git and the app runs directly on top of Rack with no framework or DSL involved).

I create the posts in Textmate (or whatever), then git commit and push. I get version control out of the box. It
feels lightweight and elegant. I promise I'll tidy up the visuals a bit - but not much. When I pared down the
fuss for the Tumblr theme I didn't think I could go any more minimal.

Hmmmm.
