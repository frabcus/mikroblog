In line with a [recent post](http://kaleidopunk.com/post/1298814342/code-burn-is-so-last-week "code burn is so last week") on my main blog, I start a new series of experiments. This blog is not sitting
on top of tumblr, posterous or wordpress. It's on the heroku platform, is written in ruby (technical details:
uses the toto gem, most things are accompilshed with git and the app runs directly on top of rack with no 
framework or DSL involved).

I create the posts in textmate (or whatever), then git commit and push. I get version control out of the box. It
feels lightweight and elegant. I promise I'll tidy up the visuals a bit - but not much. When I pared down the
fuss for the tumblr theme I didn't think I could go any more minimal.

Hmmmm.
