Something is afoot in 2011. I decided to blow the doors open, get back into my Buddhist practice in a big way, reconnect, minimise and 
see what's possible. And February stepped up. A couple of weeks back someone got in touch about a possible Ruby contract in London. I 
get a lot of calls and much gets lost in the static but I have been trying to make the leap from my current technical stack into Ruby 
for some time. 

Why? Ruby is a programming language that was invented in Japan and is optimised for human happiness. It is powerful, elegant and 
mystical - and yes that last adjective should not belong in a technical evaluation of a language but I am more writer than programmer, 
more artist than scientist and the vibration, community and inventive use of human language by that community suckered me in. So sue 
me.

I checked out the company on LinkedIn and recognised some of the connected avatars, one of them being Stuart Witts, the mind behind 
Flowery Tweetup. He recommended me to the guys at Leap Anywhere and soon after I found myself in a coffee shop in Soho with Malcolm 
Scovil (CEO) and Tony Daly (lead developer) buzzing off their energy and social ethic and they offered me the gig there and then.

So on April 18th I start working for a dynamic and socially engaged startup in Greek Street Soho, spookily the spiritual home of the 
original Tuttle Club, being paid to code Ruby (one agent told me it was very difficult, although not impossible, to switch from PHP to 
Ruby commercially). And the bonus is that the company is both immersed in the social web and is contributing to social change.

Never let anyone tell you something is impossible.
